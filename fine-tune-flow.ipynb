    "# OpenAI Fine-tuning API Flow Example\n",
    "This notebook provides a baseline example of how to use the OpenAI Fine-tuning API to fine-tune a model using a custom dataset. Included is a process for creating training and testing data in JASONL format from a CSV file and how to fine-tune and use a model using the data.\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "To use this notebook, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. You can generate one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/). Save the key in a file called `.env` in the same directory as this notebook under the variable name `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
